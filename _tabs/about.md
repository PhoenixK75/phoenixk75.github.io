I have a lot of experience in systems administration, deployment, configuration using the Hashicorp pipeline, Docker, nginx and other modern server technologies. I also am well versed in development with Python, PHP and Ruby. I can do development and deployment, but recently security is my passion. I have practiced security for several years in my freetime, and now I am just starting out professionally. I have experience with Vulnerability Scans, Reverse Engineering and Malware Analysis, Penetration testing, IDS/IPS (Surricata + ossec + snort + snorby), Anti-Virus, Firewalls and Fortinet Appliance configuration. I have initiative and am able to adequately teach myself new skills and technologies. I care more about giving a good service and leaving a happy customer than making money.
